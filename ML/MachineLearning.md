## What is Machine Learning?

The machine learning has two kinds of algorithms. One is **supervised learning**, one is **unsupervised  learning**.

- **supervised learning**
  1. Make regression:It has an input x then give an output y(the right answers also called data sets).
  2. Make classification: predict categories, like give a diagnos of breast cancer(benign or malignant).

- **unsupervised learning**
  Data only comes with inputs x, but not outputs y. The algorithm has to find the some structure through the data.
